 I want to make this about simplicity to update your workout, the reps sets
exercise. And I also want to include diet in a different tab. so to track the workout and diet in the same place. no ads,
no extra stuff.


Functional Requirements:
1. User authentication
2. manage user profile
3. manage workout.
4. manage diet.
5. make exercise name suggestions



NFRs
1. usability
    1. Fast response time: need to quantify this
    2. Very simple UI
    3. responsive
    4. show graphical stats



Stack:
1. database design:
    R vs NR: inclined towards using NR. but would be ideal to try both and compare the results.

NoSQL databases are not as well-suited for complex queries.
NoSQL databases typically have weaker security features than relational databases.
NoSQL databases are less mature and less flexible queries.
NoSQL databases can be more difficult to use than relational databases.
NoSQL databases typically have poorer security features than relational databases.

Relational databases are difficult schema evolution due to an inflexible data model.

so, we will use R for user authentication storage and NR to store workouts and diet info.
